            <p class="lead">A version control system is one you can use whenever you are working on a file and need to save it. As you keep editing a file and creating newer versions of it, a version control system is keeping track of this. Not only does it save the last and final file, but it keeps stored the previous versions of the file. This is a very useful tool for designers, programmers, etc. who work on a certain file and create various versions of it but need to keep looking back at them for errors. If you have a version control system, you can easily  go back to your previous drafts and find out what or who created the issue and see exactly where and what it is.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">People have their own ways of using version control systems, as well as they make up their own ways. Many times these ways are not efficient nor smart because of several issues that come up with them. One of these issues includes, losing different versions of one file because you stored them in various places. And if this is not the case even if you have your versions organized, you are not able to have them viewed or edited by several people unless you use another program. For these reasons, Centralized Version Control Systems were made. CVCSs were developed so one server could store all versions of files and for various people to be able to look at them, grab them, etc.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Unfortunately Centralized Version Control Systems were found not to be the best strategically. This was because if the server were to go down or even get corrupted, then nobody would be able to retrieve the files. Thankfully, Distributed Version Control Systems were developed. These systems were the answer to the problems a CVCS gave. Instead of people being able to work and view the files on one server, everyone was able to store it for themselves. Therefore, if the server were to go down or any corruption were to take place, anyone who had access to it would be able to restore it successfully.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Linux Kernel open source software project was the reason for the development of GIT. The Linux Kernel started by just distributing the versions of their software around, until they started using a distributed version control system called BitKeeper. Unfortunately problems arose between each company, which broke off their relationship. This caused the Linux society to create their own program, now called GIT. They made this program fast, easy to use and available for anyone who needed it. They made it their goal for GIT to abstain from the problems BitKeeper had and to be a more technologically advanced program.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The most important concepts you need to know about Git, are the commands. Fortunately these commands are easy, fast and simple to use. The first step to using Git is to obtain a git repository. You can either import your own project unto Git or you could start with another server and have it duplicate with Git. If you want to track your project initializing in Git you begin with the command “git init”. After this command, you can begin version-controlling and looking for previous files with the commands “git add” and “git commit”. Now if you want to duplicate a project that you would like to edit or use you use the command “git clone” This command is very helpful because it does not only “copy” or “clone” this project, but it also receives almost the complete data in the server. Although these commands can get confusing once you use Git and experiment with it on your own, you will find how fast and easy it really is!</p>
